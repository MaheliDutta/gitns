## Github Issue Page Clone
In the project, first, collect open issues from Githubâ€™s API and display them in a list. After this, add a pagination control to facilitate navigation across a complete list of issues. If we add React Router, we can navigate directly to a particular page of your choice. we can increase the complexity of the page by including the issue detail page as well.<br>
